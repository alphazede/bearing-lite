# Verified host mapping

This adapter is the verified native mapping for hosts that share a
session-start / stop command hook. Coverage is **partial**: activation and
closeout are executable; transition-order and protected-action stay
procedural.

## Hosts

| Host | Plugin install | Hooks | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `.claude-plugin/` marketplace | `hooks/hooks.json` | partial |
| Codex | `.codex-plugin/` + `.agents/plugins/` | `hooks/hooks.json` | partial |
| Grok Build | `.grok-plugin/` marketplace | `hooks/hooks.json` | partial |
| Cursor | `.cursor-plugin/` | `hooks/com.cursor/hooks.json` (`sessionStart`, `stop`) | partial |
| Kimi Code | `.kimi-plugin/plugin.json` | manifest `hooks` array | partial |
| AGY | `.agy/` (strict `plugin.json`) | none | skills-only |
| Pi | `package.json` `"pi"` + `pi-package` | none (TypeScript extensions, not command hooks) | skills-only |
| DeepCode | `.deepcode/skills` or interoperable `.agents/skills` discovery | none | skills-only |

Do **not** set `hooks` on Claude, Codex, or Grok host manifests. Those hosts
auto-load `hooks/hooks.json`; declaring both is a duplicate-file error.

Skill-copy into a host skills directory does **not** register hooks. Plugin
install or disable uses the host's native controls. Bearing Lite never copies
adapters into global hook configuration.

## Event map

| Host event names | Bearing class | Executable? |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionStart`, `sessionStart`, `session_start` | activation | yes, advisory |
| `Stop`, `stop` | closeout | yes, advisory only |
| any other host event | none | unmapped; fail open as `UNAVAILABLE` |

The shared planning-review evaluator is used by transition and closeout when a
client supplies a structured `planning_review` record. Current session-start /
stop mappings cannot derive that nested record safely, so Claude Code, Codex,
Grok Build, Cursor, and Kimi remain partial and the check is procedural there.
AGY, Pi, and DeepCode remain skills-only. Do not claim full planning-review
enforcement for any of these hosts until a native event supplies the complete
record.

The adapter accepts snake_case and camelCase (`hook_event_name` /
`hookEventName`, `cwd` / `workspaceRoot`).

## Derived fields

The host event supplies session metadata. The adapter reads visible Markdown
under `cwd` (bounded; skips `skills/`, `hooks/`, `test/`, and dependency
trees) and sets only:

| Bearing field | Source |
|---|---|
| `plan_present` | a Markdown file contains a `task_id`, `assigned_role`, non-placeholder journey marker, or `checkout_lease` block |
| `router_invoked` | a non-placeholder `- journey:` setting is present, including the Journey identity nested inside the `checkout_lease` block |
| `assigned_role` | active task `assigned_role` when not `unassigned` or `<…>` |
| `next_action` / `next_action_known` | active task `next_action` when not a placeholder |
| closeout handoff fields | matching task-record keys when present. Receipt `verdict` is a closed role-return token; task `outcome` is approved intent and is not mapped into the receipt |

`assigned_role` and `router_invoked` are **not** inferred from the tool-call
payload. Missing values stay missing, so activation advises the router instead
of inventing context.

The Router writes the visible `checkout_lease` before any planning write or
dispatch; its nested non-placeholder Journey identity is the Router-invoked
signal during planning. The plan-level Explorer-versus-Expedition value is
recorded later at the route review.

## Outcome translation

| Outcome | Host JSON | Process exit |
|---|---|---|
| `ADVISE`, `REROUTE`, `UNAVAILABLE` on activation or a discoverable-Journey first-pass Stop | `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` | always `0` |
| Stop/SubagentStop re-entry (`stop_hook_active`) | quiet success (empty JSON; no `additionalContext`) | always `0` |
| Stop/SubagentStop with no discoverable Journey | quiet success (empty JSON; no `additionalContext`) | always `0` |
| first-pass Stop/SubagentStop with a discoverable Journey | `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` | always `0` |
| `BLOCK` | JSON `decision: "block"` only; this mapping never requests protected completion | always `0` |

A discoverable Journey is a visible plan with a `task_id`, `assigned_role`,
non-placeholder journey marker, or `checkout_lease` block. Empty cwd and
`stop_hook_active` re-entry stay quiet. Never map policy or infrastructure to
a non-zero exit.
