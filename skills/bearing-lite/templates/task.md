# Task record template

Use one compact Markdown block per task in the project's existing plan or progress document. Omit unused conditional fields. Prefer the project's format; add only missing fields. Do not create a Bearing-owned state file or hidden ledger.

## Journey settings

Map the Route records these plan-level proposals above the task blocks in the
complete five-artifact package. The integrated owner review approves or changes
the journey, lineup, role states, reasoning, cadence, and plan together; no
pre-Map lineup or route-review gate is allowed.

```markdown
- journey: <Explorer Journey | Expedition>
- review_cadence: at-end
- choice_basis: <proposed recommendation and reason; owner-approved at integrated review>
- lineup_snapshot: <named implementation/assurance instances plus the planning_review binding below>
- planning_review:
  - policy_ref: skills/bearing-lite/references/review-policy.md
  - candidate_ref: <shared planning-package reference>
  - candidate_revision: <shared planning-package revision>
  - candidate_digest: <shared planning-package digest>
  - reviewer_slots:
    - slot_id: <abstract unique slot>
      primary_route_ref: <owner-selected lineup route reference>
      fallback_route_refs: [<ordered owner-selected route references>]
  - round_number: 1
  - completed_rounds: <0-1>
  - receipts: <one isolated receipt per slot, including the distinct selected_route_ref>
  - aggregated_repairs: <0-1>
  - deterministic_gate: <PASS after repair; otherwise omitted>
```

`review_cadence` is `at-end` only. The single independent review runs on the
final integrated candidate, not at a slice or round boundary, and not as
task-level tests or author self-checks. Never infer it from
`required_assurance` on an individual task. The proposal is visible in
`implementation.md` and `review.html`, then becomes authoritative only after
the integrated owner approval; do not offer `per-slice` or `per-round`.
`journey` stays a proposal until the mapped implementation graph exists and the
integrated owner review approves it. `lineup_snapshot` is authoritative after
that approval. Later
edits to `~/.agents/bearing-lite/default-role-lineup.md` have no effect.
Replace it only through an explicit owner-confirmed dated visible amendment.
Record the amendment date beside the replacement values. Dispatch identities
come from this snapshot, not from the current global defaults file.

Every configured planning-review slot uses the same candidate ref, revision,
and digest. Findings stay isolated until one aggregation. Slot exhaustion is
`FAIL_ROUND`; policy violations halt or require an owner amendment. The binding
does not populate `required_assurance` and does not dispatch reviewers.

## Checkout lease (record before any planning write)

The Router's first write is this visible lease. Inventory nonterminal Journeys
first. Do not dispatch or write other planning state until the lease is
`active` for this Journey.

```markdown
- checkout_lease:
  - journey: <Journey id>
  - controller: <Router>
  - repository: <canonical repository>
  - checkout: <worktree or checkout identity>
  - branch: <branch>
  - candidate_revision: <candidate revision>
  - acquired_at: <acquisition time>
  - generation: <positive integer>
  - state: <active | released>
```

Same checkout plus a live other Journey returns `WAITING_ON` with sanitized
competing Journey and controller identities. Distinct explicitly approved
compatible worktrees may proceed. Resume keeps the same generation and does
not duplicate dispatch. Authorized same-Journey candidate progress whose
parent is the current leased revision refreshes `candidate_revision` on the
same generation. `COMPLETE` or `CANCELLED` releases the lease exactly
once. Stale recovery is explicit, recorded, increments generation, and cannot
steal a live lease. Process discovery cannot replace this durable lease.

## Wave receipt (record at wave start)

Continuations reuse this visible record beside the checkout lease. Validate at
wave start, after detected drift, and before commit — not before every
mutation. Resume from it; do not reread every accepted artifact or redispatch
completed slices.

```markdown
- wave_receipt:
  - wave: <wave id>
  - lease_generation: <generation>
  - branch: <branch>
  - candidate_revision: <revision at last check>
  - authority: <envelope>
  - checked_at: <wave_start | external_change | commit>
```

Stale, forged, or drifted receipts fail closed. Changed HEAD, authority,
generation, route, or writer overlap forces revalidation or a fresh session.

## Always present

```markdown
### task_id: T1
- outcome: <approved user-visible outcome for this task>
- status: PROPOSED
- assigned_role: <role or unassigned>
- depends_on: []
- next_action: <smallest concrete next step>
```

Field rules:

- `task_id` — stable identifier unique within the plan.
- `outcome` — approved intent for this task only. Never a role-return token and never copied into `verdict`.
- `status` — one of `PROPOSED`, `READY`, `WAITING_ON`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `EVIDENCE_READY`, `VALIDATING`, `REVIEWING`, `ACCEPTANCE`, `CORRECTION_REQUIRED`, `OWNER_DECISION_REQUIRED`, `COMPLETE`, `CANCELLED`.
- `assigned_role` — current role contract for the active step, or unassigned while proposing.
- `depends_on` — list of other `task_id` values only, never prose.
- `next_action` — the immediate allowed step.

## Before execution (add when leaving PROPOSED)

```markdown
- scope: <allowed paths, systems, and boundaries>
- authority: <approved envelope; protected actions remain owner-only>
- required_assurance: [Validator]
```

`required_assurance` lists only roles that must accept the same candidate (for example `Validator`, and `Park Ranger` or `Surveyor` when their triggers apply).

## After candidate work (add when evidence exists)

```markdown
- candidate_ref: <strongest native revision or changed-path reference available>
- changed_paths: <paths changed in this candidate>
- tests: <commands run and observed results>
- findings: <labeled inferences and gaps>
- verdict: <closed role-return token>
- assurance_rounds: <0-1 completed assurance rounds for this Journey>
```

`verdict` is one of `ACCEPT`, `ACCEPT_WITH_FINDINGS`, `BLOCK`, `CANDIDATE_READY`, `FAIL`, `GAPS`, `NEEDS_MORE_EVIDENCE`, `OWNER_DECISION_REQUIRED`, `PARTIAL`, `PASS`, `READY`, `REPAIR_REQUIRED`, `REROUTED`, `WAITING_ON`. Do not copy task `outcome` into `verdict`.
`candidate_ref` must not claim stronger provenance than the client can prove.
`assurance_rounds` counts the Journey's single submission to required assurance
against Bearing Lite `max_assurance_rounds`. A repair or replacement candidate
does not reset it; only a separately scoped, materially changed new Journey starts at 0, and a new Journey is not a way around the bound. The parent
coordinator writes the count before dispatch. If the review permits correction, spend at
most one remaining `attempts` repair, run deterministic coordinator verification,
and close the gate without another review. A failed repair or scope change
returns `OWNER_DECISION_REQUIRED`.

## Waiting or correcting only

```markdown
- blocker: <WAITING_ON:<task-id> | typed reason | none on success>
- attempts: <0-3 correction attempts for this task or protected action>
```

Omit `blocker` and `attempts` when the task is not waiting or correcting. Waiting does not consume correction attempts.

`COMPLETE` ends Bearing assurance. An already authorized deployment keeps its
own operational checks and rollback evidence but does not reopen independent
review. Any source or candidate change during deployment is separately scoped.

## Single-writer reminder

Only the parent coordinator updates this block after rereading it. Crewmate, Validator, Park Ranger, and Surveyor return compact receipts (`verdict`, `candidate_ref`, `changed_paths`, `tests`, `findings`, `blocker`); the coordinator records transitions. Router alone changes cross-wave dependencies or global sequencing. Update `implementation.md` and `review.html` once per wave, plus owner-decision or blocker changes.
